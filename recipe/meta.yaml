  summary: 'solders is a high-performance Python toolkit for Solana'
  description: |
    solders is a high-performance Python toolkit for Solana, written in Rust. It provides robust
    solutions to the following problems:
       - Core SDK stuff: keypairs, pubkeys, signing and serializing transactions - that sort of thing.
       - RPC stuff: building requests and parsing responses (no networking stuff - if you want help with that,
    solana-py is your friend).
       - Integration testing stuff: the solders.bankrun module is an alternative to solana-test-validator
    that's much more convenient and much faster. It's based on solana-program-test if you know that is.
